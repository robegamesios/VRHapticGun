# VR Haptic Gun - Arizona Sunshine Support

Arizona Sunshine gameplay: coming soon

    
# Software: 
I forked a BHaptics Arizona Sunshine repo and updated it to work with the gun's ebb. Credits goes to Florian Fahrenberger https://github.com/floh-bhaptics for creating the original implementation.

1. Install MelonLoader: https://melonwiki.xyz/#/

2. Copy the contents of Publish folder https://github.com/robegamesios/VRHapticGun/tree/main/Games/Arizona%20Sunshine/Publish to your Arizona Sunshine MelonLoader Mods folder (e.g. C:\\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arizona Sunshine\Mods)


3. Open `hapticGunConfig.txt` 
    a. Change the first line to your dominant hand (e.g. Right) Gun's IP Address.

    b. If you changed the Port number in the firmware, then update the second line to the correct port number you are using. 

    c. If you have another Haptic gun you want to use for your non-dominant hand (e.g. Left), change the third line to your non-dominant hand Gun's IP Address. 

    d. Save and close the file. You only need to do this once until you need to update your guns' IP address and port number.


4. Launch SteamVR and start Pistol Whip.

NOTE: This app will work with the Haptic Gun even if you do not have BHaptics gear (tactsuit, tactosy, etc). Likewise, it should work with BHaptics gear without having a Haptic Gun.

# VR Haptic Gun - Pistol Whip Support

Pistol Whip gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaUro4AgwZc

    
# Software: 
I forked a BHaptics Pistol Whip repo and updated it to work with the gun's ebb. Credits goes to Florian Fahrenberger https://github.com/floh-bhaptics for creating the original implementation.

1. Install MelonLoader: https://melonwiki.xyz/#/

2. Copy the contents of Publish folder https://github.com/robegamesios/VRHapticGun/tree/main/Games/PistolWhip/Publish to your Pistol Whip MelonLoader Mods folder (e.g. C:\\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Pistol Whip\Mods)

3. Open `hapticGunConfig.txt` and change the first line to your gun's IP Address. If you changed the Port number in the firmware, then update the second line to the correct port number you are using. Then save and close the file. You only need to do this once until you need to update your gun's IP address and port number.

4. Launch SteamVR and start Pistol Whip.

NOTE: This app will work with the Haptic Gun even if you do not have BHaptics gear (tactsuit, tactosy, etc). Likewise, it should work with BHaptics gear without having a Haptic Gun.
